# Employee Retention on HR Dataset Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze employee retention using a HR dataset. Employee retention is a crucial aspect of organizational success, as high turnover rates can be detrimental to productivity, morale, and overall performance. By exploring the HR dataset, we seek to identify factors that contribute to employee turnover and develop insights to help organizations improve retention strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various attributes related to employees, such as satisfaction level, evaluation scores, number of projects, average monthly hours worked, time spent at the company, whether they have had a work accident, whether they have left the company, etc. Each attribute provides valuable information that can be leveraged to understand patterns and trends in employee retention.

## Goals
- Identify key factors influencing employee retention.
- Develop predictive models to forecast employee turnover.
- Provide actionable insights and recommendations for improving retention strategies.

## Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing distributions, correlations, and visualizing patterns in the data to gain insights into factors affecting retention.
3. Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.
4. Model Building: Implementing machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting to predict employee turnover.
5. Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. Interpretation and Recommendations: Interpreting model results to understand the importance of different features in predicting turnover and providing actionable recommendations for HR strategies.
